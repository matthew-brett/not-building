# AKA

**The long uphill struggle of** Building foundations for foundations of data
science in a UK university.

# My background

* 1996 -- : Teaching / research in neuroscience, brain imaging.
* 2005 -- : using, contributing to scientific Python.
* 2008 -- 2017 : working at Berkeley Brain Imaging Center.
* 2013 -- : code-first courses on brain imaging, data science.
* 2017 -- : Lecturer in Data Science, University of Birmingham

# Birmingham background

* Large mid-upper tier UK university (23K / 12K, undergraduate / postgrads).
* Five "colleges" each containing a handful of "schools".
* I'm in the "College of Life and Environmental Sciences", with schools:
    * Psychology
    * Geography, environment
    * Biosciences
    * Sports, Exercise

# UK issues

* No tradition of cross-school teaching.
* Government funding puts heavy emphasis on research metrics:
    * Low priority of teaching.
* Schools sensitive to UK student satisfaction survey results:
    * Grade inflation.
    * Making courses easier.
    * Risk aversion.
* Turing Institute.

# Probably everyone's issues

* What is data science?

In practice: a vaguely defined post-graduate or vocational discipline that is
mainly for computer science graduates, and has something to do with big data
and machine learning.

# More of everyone's issues

* Many students outside math, CS, physical sciences dropped math at age 16,
  and have no calculus, or recent practice with algebra.
* Existing traditions of statistics teaching in each school.
* Faculty can be frightened by, and dismissive of, code as a requirement for
  data analysis.
* Existing technologies defended against alternatives: SPSS, Excel, Matlab, R,
  Python.

# What I did

* Advocacy - talks and demonstrations to fellow teachers.
* R teaching to replace SPSS / Excel teaching.
    * R / data science half-course for geographers, bioscientists.
* Optional data-8-like course for undergraduates.
* Fuller data-8-like course for Psychology masters students.
* "Hacker Within" peer learning group.
* All materials [free, online](https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2019/) with
  license that allows modification.

# What I'd like to do

* Form a peer learning group for teaching data science.
* Share work on:
    * Open, freely adaptable materials.
    * Adapt to different levels of coding and math ability.
    * Adapt to different teaching approaches (Pandas, datascience library,
      lists and dicts ..., CS vs statistics emphasis, Bayian vs frequentist.
    * Share knowledge, development for autograding.
    * Find system for sharing problem sets with autograde solutions.
* Find a way to wean students from Jupyter Notebooks ...
